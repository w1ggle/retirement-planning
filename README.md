## THIS IS IN NO WAY FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT CERTIFIED, JUST A GUY WHOS TRYING TO LEARN MORE SO HE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HIS PARENTS SITUATION

I've been learning a little bit about retirement in the past month since my parents are thinking about it in the near future but they are not quite sure how it works. 
I just wanted to be helpful so I've used a lot of Google-fu and Youtbe-fu to learn somethings so I can help my parents.

I thought, why not try to jot down what Ive learned somewhere (so that its not all in my head), so I decided why not try to code something.

Yes I know there are probably calculators online that already do this, but I also wanted to do this as a fun learning challenge, so "why not?" is what I say
